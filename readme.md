# Hiya!

Ok, so I was a little confused on what exactly the test program was supposed to do, it seemed that was supposed to validate an output from an endpoint, but I couldn't validate that with the given endpoints. So I hope that was correct. :)

If it was not, I'd love it if you let me know the scope of the assignment and I'll build it correctly.

Hope y'all don't mind me, I just didn't want to fail on the premise of assignment confusion.

Hope to speak to you soon!
